Tasktracker is a tool for tracking tasks.

It currently allows for:

* timed/untimed tasks

* set due date or schedule for a specific date

* recurring tasks (still a little buggy)

It will eventually allow for prioritization and/or a scoring system. The scoring system
would make it possible to set overall goals for productivity.
